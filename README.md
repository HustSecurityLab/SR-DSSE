# SR-DSSE
Source code of the paper entitled "Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption with Strong  Security and Robustness"

For IM-DSSE, we directly use the source code provided by [Thang Hoang et. al.](https://github.com/thanghoang/IM-DSSE)

## Pre-Requests

To compile and run this code, cmake, [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) library, [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) library, and [TFHE](https://tfhe.github.io/tfhe/) are needed.

Some code read keys from ".key" files. Those ".key" files are generated by generating TFHE secret key and saving the generated keys to the disk using the API provided by the TFHE library.

Any questions related to the code please contact the first author of the paper HaoChen Dou.
